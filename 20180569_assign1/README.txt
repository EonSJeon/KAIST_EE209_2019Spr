20180569 Jeon Sangeon Assign1

Monday, tuesday, thursday TAs help me with assign1.
They advised me to do homework only with DFA and not to do with array.
Also, they teached me how to use bash command.

I spent about 7 hours downloading programs and being accostumed to bash command
, about 7 hours in coding and drawing DFA, and 9 hours testing the program.

20180569 Jeon Sangeon Assign 4

1. I use all my late pass(3 days) for this assignment.
2. It takes very long time to get to know the problem was the size of data(bytewise)
3. Error in opds(lack of opds, negative and positive problem) mostly ends
   without influencing contents of stack except the followings.
   1) When there's negative opd for % op 
   2) When negative exponent for ^ op
   These two cases ends with poping two opds.
